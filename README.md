Want to go solar? First order of business is calculate your usage. That's what this app does.

To help guage, cost (FYI solar is expensive) it breaks down your usage into 3 categories

* Need (like lights and fans)
* Want (fridge)
* Luxury (coffee maker)

Secondly, this app helps you size your system.

* Grid tied - least expensive - best ROI
* Off grid - using batteries - expensive but worth it if you don't have a POC or your POC is expensive
* Hybrid - both batteries and grid tied - most expensive
